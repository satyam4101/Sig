# Signify
A translator for the Challenged.
We believe in the importance of bridging communities together, especially in places with large and thriving Deaf & signing communities. That inspired us to create the app, so our friends could reach new heights. 
A software which could support people who cannot speak. Speech impaired people face a lot of setbacks. They have various ideas and the will to create a better society, but they do not get the support due to communication barriers.
A Helping Hand and a stepping stone for the differently abled who want to make there own and others around them less burdened. This App will help them communicate with the people anywhere, anytime without being dependent on someone else.
This is designed to be used on the go and one-handed; so you can already start practicing with friends, family, or loved ones! You can use with friends, at bars, at coffee houses, at restaurants, on the metro, waiting in line, and so on. The goal here is to get you going and confident that when you meet a deaf person, you can start a conversation.
